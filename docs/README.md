## Jazz, Pop, Prog, and the Modes: A Musicological Analysis

### Modes

- I love modes and through some tragedy was not exposed to [George Russell's Lydian Chromatic Concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydian_Chromatic_Concept_of_Tonal_Organization) in [music school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_University_of_New_York_at_Purchase). When I started reading this text I was delighted by the concept of tonal gravity. It is intuitive in the way that stacked fifths ascend and all the partials dance around in that context, leaving your ears and brain to figure out. 
  
### Modes in Genres 

- Modes are a series of tones that create unique sonic landscapes. Analyzing their suitability for various musical genres requires understanding the characteristic sonic underpinnings of each genre. Here's a breakdown of the suitability of different modes in jazz, pop, prog, and progressive genres:

### Mode Usage

| Mode | Jazz | Pop | Prog | Prog-Rock/Metal | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dorian (♭3, ♯6) | High ("So What" by Miles Davis) | Moderate | Moderate | High ("Shine On You Crazy Diamond" by Pink Floyd - sections) |  |
| Phrygian (♭2, ♭3, ♯6) | Moderate ("Spain" by Chick Corea) | Low | High | High ("The Count of Tuscany" by Dream Theater) |  |
| Lydian (♭7, ♯4, ♯6) | Moderate | High ("Africa" by Toto - chorus) | High ("Riders on the Storm" by The Doors - intro) | Moderate |  |
| Mixolydian (♭7, ♭6) | High ("All Blues" by Miles Davis) | Moderate | Moderate | High ("Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen - solo sections) |  |
| Aeolian (Natural Minor) | Moderate | High ("Yesterday" by The Beatles) | Moderate ("Hotel California" by Eagles - sections) | Moderate |  |
| Locrian (♭2, ♭3, ♭5, ♭6, ♭7) | Low (Rarely Used) | Low | High | High ("Raining Blood" by Slayer) |  |

### Further Analysis

* **Jazz:** Heavily utilizes Dorian, Phrygian, and Mixolydian modes for their improvisational freedom and bluesy character.
* **Pop:** Often leans towards major and minor keys for accessibility, but Lydian and Aeolian modes find use for their bright and melancholic qualities, respectively.
* **Prog:** Actively utilizes modes due to their complex and unconventional sounds. Phrygian, Locrian, and even Dorian find application here.
* **Prog-Rock/Metal:** Extends the boundaries of traditional prog, incorporating even more dissonant modes like Locrian.

**Note:** These are complete generalizations, and many exceptions exist. I sometimes saw how jingle writers would use these and other devices to enrich or add specificity and vibe to their tracks. 

## More Examples

* "So What" by Miles Davis is built on the Dorian mode, creating a relaxed and bluesy feel. The major 6th adds lift.
