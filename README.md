## Jazz, Pop, Prog, and the Modes: A Musicological Analysis


- I love modes and through some tragedy was not exposed to George Russell's Lydian Chromatic Concept in music school. When I started reading this text I was delighted by the concept of tonal gravity. It is intuitive in the way that stacked fifths ascend and all the partials dance around in that context, leaving your ears and brain to figure out. whilst it hurt my brain to try to 

- Modes are melodic scales that create unique sonic landscapes. Analyzing their suitability for various musical genres requires understanding the characteristic sounds and theoretical underpinnings of each genre. Here's a breakdown of the suitability of different modes in jazz, pop, prog, and progressive forms of these genres:

Mode	Jazz	Pop	Prog	Prog-Rock/Metal	Examples
Dorian (♭3, ♯6)	High	Moderate	Moderate	High	* Jazz: "So What" by Miles Davis <br> * Prog-Rock: "Shine On You Crazy Diamond" by Pink Floyd (sections)
Phrygian (♭2, ♭3, ♯6)	Moderate	Low	High	High	* Jazz: "Spain" by Chick Corea <br> * Prog-Metal: "The Count of Tuscany" by Dream Theater
Lydian (♭7, ♯4, ♯6)	Moderate	High	High	Moderate	* Pop: "Africa" by Toto (chorus) <br> * Prog: "Riders on the Storm" by The Doors (intro)
Mixolydian (♭7, ♭6)	High	Moderate	Moderate	High	* Jazz: "All Blues" by Miles Davis <br> * Prog-Rock: "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen (solo sections)
Aeolian (Natural Minor)	Moderate	High	Moderate	Moderate	* Pop: "Yesterday" by The Beatles <br> * Prog: "Hotel California" by Eagles (sections)
Locrian (♭2, ♭3, ♭5, ♭6, ♭7)	Low	Low	High	High	* Jazz: Rarely used due to its dissonant nature <br> * Prog-Metal: "Raining Blood" by Slayer

### Further Analysis:

- Jazz: Heavily utilizes Dorian, Phrygian, and Mixolydian modes for their improvisational freedom and bluesy character.
- Pop: Often leans towards major and minor keys for accessibility, but Lydian and Aeolian modes find use for their bright and melancholic qualities, respectively.
- **Prog:**積極的にモードを活用 (kakuteki ni mōdo o katsuyō suru,積極的に = actively, モード = mode, 活用 = use) [actively utilizes modes] due to their complex and unconventional sounds. Phrygian, Locrian, and even Dorian find application here.
- Prog-Rock/Metal: Extends the boundaries of traditional prog, incorporating even more dissonant modes like Locrian.
Note: These are generalizations, and exceptions exist. Artists constantly push boundaries.

### More Examples:

- The iconic "So What" by Miles Davis is built on the Dorian mode, creating a relaxed and bluesy feel. The major 6th adds lift
