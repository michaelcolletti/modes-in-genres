## Jazz, Pop, Prog, and the Modes: A Musicological Analysis


- I love modes and through some tragedy was not exposed to George Russell's Lydian Chromatic Concept in music school. When I started reading this text I was delighted by the concept of tonal gravity. It is intuitive in the way that stacked fifths ascend and all the partials dance around in that context, leaving your ears and brain to figure out. 

- Modes are melodic scales that create unique sonic landscapes. Analyzing their suitability for various musical genres requires understanding the characteristic sounds and theoretical underpinnings of each genre. Here's a breakdown of the suitability of different modes in jazz, pop, prog, and progressive forms of these genres:

<summary>Further Analysis</summary>

    Jazz: Heavily utilizes Dorian, Phrygian, and Mixolydian modes for their improvisational freedom and bluesy character.
    Pop: Often leans towards major and minor keys for accessibility, but Lydian and Aeolian modes find use for their bright and melancholic qualities, respectively.
    Prog: Actively utilizes modes due to their complex and unconventional sounds. Phrygian, Locrian, and even Dorian find application here.
    Prog-Rock/Metal: Extends the boundaries of traditional prog, incorporating even more dissonant modes like Locrian.

Note: These are generalizations, and exceptions exist. Artists constantly push boundaries.
