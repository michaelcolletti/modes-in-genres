Analyzing their suitability for various musical genres requires understanding the characteristic sounds and theoretical underpinnings of each genre. Here's a breakdown of the suitability of different modes in jazz, pop, prog, and progressive forms of these genres: Mode Usage in Different Genres Dorian (\u266d3, \u266f6) Jazz: High usage Example: \"So What\" by Miles Davis Pop: Moderate usage Prog: Moderate usage Prog-Rock/Metal: High usage Example: \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" by Pink Floyd (sections) Phrygian (\u266d2, \u266d3, \u266f6) Jazz: Moderate usage Example: \"Spain\" by Chick Corea Pop: Low usage Prog: High usage Prog-Rock/Metal: High usage Example: \"The Count of Tuscany\" by Dream Theater Lydian (\u266d7, \u266f4, \u266f6) Jazz: Moderate usage Pop: High usage Example: \"Africa\" by Toto (chorus) Prog: High usage Example: \"Riders on the Storm\" by The Doors (intro) Prog-Rock/Metal: Moderate usage Mixolydian (\u266d7, \u266d6) Jazz: High usage Example: \"All Blues\" by Miles Davis Pop: Moderate usage Prog: Moderate usage Prog-Rock/Metal: High usage Example: \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by Queen (solo sections) Aeolian (Natural Minor) Jazz: Moderate usage Pop: High usage Example: \"Yesterday\" by The Beatles Prog: Moderate usage Example: \"Hotel California\" by Eagles (sections) Prog-Rock/Metal: Moderate usage Locrian (\u266d2, \u266d3, \u266d5, \u266d6, \u266d7) Jazz: Low usage (rarely used due to its dissonant nature) Pop: Low usage Prog: High usage Prog-Rock/Metal: High usage Example: \"Raining Blood\" by Slayer Further Analysis Jazz: Heavily utilizes Dorian, Phrygian, and Mixolydian modes for their improvisational freedom and bluesy character. Pop: Often leans towards major and minor keys for accessibility, but Lydian and Aeolian modes find use for their bright and melancholic qualities, respectively. Prog: Actively utilizes modes due to their complex and unconventional sounds. Phrygian, Locrian, and even Dorian find application here. Prog-Rock/Metal: Extends the boundaries of traditional prog, incorporating even more dissonant modes like Locrian. Note: These are generalizations, and exceptions exist. Artists constantly push boundaries. More Examples The iconic \"So What\" by Miles Davis is built on the Dorian mode, creating a relaxed and bluesy feel. The major 6th adds lift.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#jazz-pop-prog-and-the-modes-a-musicological-analysis","text":"I love modes and through some tragedy was not exposed to George Russell's Lydian Chromatic Concept in music school.
